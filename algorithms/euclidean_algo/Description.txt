The Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 numbers.

EUCLIDEAN GCD(x, y: Integers):
    Let / be taken to be floor division and 
    % to be the remainder operation (modulo)
    
    Let a, b, r be integers.
    Set a=x, b=y so that x, y are not modified.
    Do the following first:
        Set r=a%b.
        If r is 0, we are done.
            Return b as the GCD of x and y.
        Otherwise, 
            Set a=b, b=r.
            Loop once more.
