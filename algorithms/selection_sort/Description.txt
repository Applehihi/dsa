Traverse through the unsorted part of the list, select the minimum element and place it at the bottom of the unsorted part.
The minimum element then becomes part of the sorted list.
Repeat until the entire list is sorted.

Assume 1 indexed sequence
INSERTION SORT(Seq: Sequence of n elements):
    Given a relation R on each element to be satisfied,
    For i = 1 to n:
        Current_minimum_index = i
        For j = 2 to n:
            If R(Seq[Current_minimum_index], Seq[j]) holds, Current_minimum_index = j
            //Note that the direction is reversed; the smaller of the two will be placed into Current_minimum
        Swap Seq[i] and Seq[Current_minimum_index]
    Return Seq as sorted according to R
