Compare every adjacent element and swap them if they are not in the right order.

Assume 1 indexed sequence
BUBBLE SORT(Seq: Sequence of n elements):
    Given a relation R on each element to be satisfied,
    For i = 1 to n-1:
    //Discount the topmost element because there is no higher element it needs to be compared to.
        For j = 1 to n-i:
        //The greatest element will bubble up to the top, so we don't need to compare them
        //and only need to consider the unsorted elements.
            If R(Seq[j], Seq[j+1]) holds, swap Seq[j] and Seq[j+1]
    Return Seq as sorted according to R
