Possibly not memory safe 
    potential for memory leak with begin(), although can be resolved
    if begin does not return anything
    might have other unknown vectors

Might consider method chaining
    non-mutating methods can return a reference to this which
    allows more methods to be chained on, making syntax more
    convenient
