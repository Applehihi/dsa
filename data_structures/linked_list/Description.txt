A (singly) linked list contains nodes which refer to other nodes in a chain.

Each node contains some set of data as well as a reference to the next node.

A linked list thus acts as a wrapper for this chain of nodes.

LinkedList {
    members:
        Node* head;
        Node* current;
    methods:
        None append(Generic);
        None push(Generic);
        None clear(None);
        Generic getData(None);
        Node* next(None);
        Node* begin(None);
}

Node {
    members:
        Generic data;
        Node* next;
    methods:
        Generic getData(None);
        None setData(Generic data);
        Node* getNext(None);
        None setNext(Node* next);
}
